# 🌱 Sustainable Smart Farming System using MERN Stack

This project is a Smart Farming Web Application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It is designed to help farmers digitally manage sensor data, crop records, and their own profiles through a personalized dashboard. Though real-time sensors are not used in this version due to unavailability, the system simulates realistic sensor data for demo purposes.
